# Statistical Arbitrage Framework (Kalman Filter Edition)

A modular Python framework for **statistical arbitrage**, focusing on **Kalman-filtered, time-varying hedge ratios**, cointegration-style spread modeling, rolling ADF stationarity testing, signal generation, and full backtesting.

This project enables you to:
- Fetch historical market data (Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`)
- Estimate dynamic hedge ratios using a **Kalman Filter**
- Construct spreads and test them for **stationarity**
- Generate long/short trading signals
- Run backtests on individual pairs or full batches
- Produce performance reports for each pair

The project is built for scalability, reproducibility, and batch automation (overnight runs).

## 🚀 Features

### 📉 Data Handling
- Uses a `DataHandler` class built on `yfinance`
- Ensures completeness checks and business-day alignment
- Supports multi-asset data pulls

### 🔧 Kalman Filter Hedge Ratio
- Online estimation of β(t) between two assets
- Adaptive spread construction
  `spread(t) = price_1(t) - β(t) * price_2(t)`

### 📈 Statistical Testing
- Rolling **ADF** stationarity test
- Threshold detection for entry/exit signals

### 🔁 Backtesting Engine
- Signal-driven long/short execution
- PnL tracking
- Sharpe ratio, hit ratio, trade stats
- Daily equity curve generation

### 🧪 Batch Mode
Run dozens or hundreds of pairs overnight:
- Parallel or sequential execution
- Dump results into structured reports (JSON, CSV, plots)
